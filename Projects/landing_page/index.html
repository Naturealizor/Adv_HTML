            Hi, my name is Jacob Jordan and I've been attending clases at butler overall about 5 years now.
            After going for a few years after highschool I made the desicion to drop out and do some traveling. 
            This also meant hopping from one low paying job to another. Doing this for about six years taught me alot, like being poor is not much fun. 
            I ended up coming back in the fall of 2016, and shortly after started looking more into coding. 
            I've spent the past two and a half almost three years learning everything I can about software/web development. 
            I've managed to complete my first Microsoft certification for Software Development Fundamentals, 
            I attended my first hackathon in St. Louis where my team and I managed to make it into the finals,
            and as of this month I've started my own business freelancing as a Software Developer. As for languages, I've studied HTML and CSS (of course), 
            PHP and MySQL, C#, C++, Java, Python, and a touch of Javascript.
